### What is Opvious?

Opvious is a _batteries-included optimization platform_. It __empowers data scientists to solve optimization problems__.

Breaking it down:

+ _Optimization_: Opvious supports linear, mixed-integer, and quadratic [mathematical programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization).
+ _Platform_: Opvious is much more than a library. Underneath the SDKs and integrations is a [modern API](https://api.cloud.opvious.io/openapi.yaml) powered by distributed infrastructure.
+ _Batteries-included_: Opvious has everything you need to start optimizing - no separate solver license or installation required.


### How is Opvious different?

#### Transparency

Opvious' model representation is _just math_. You can be confident that any model's implementation is consistent with its mathematical specification since the specification itself is the source of truth.


#### Portability

All Opvious models can be created and solved with API calls: create a model once (for example from a Python notebook or a CI pipeline) then immediately use it from another environment: another notebook, a backend service, Google Sheetsâ„¢, ...


#### Simplicity

Opvious comes with all the tools needed to build, productionize, and maintain optimization models. A single SDK gives access to a high-performance solver, extensive model validations, powerful debugging features, and more.


### Interested in trying it out?

Opvious is available both as a managed cloud service (free on small datasets) and self-hosted (free for non-commercial projects).
