Opvious is a __batteries-included optimization platform__ which enables businesses to efficiently translate ideas into impact.

+ _Optimization_: Opvious supports linear, mixed-integer, and quadratic [mathematical programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization). Our declarative modeling library and extensive tooling are designed to keep complexity in check for models of all sizes.
+ _Platform_: Opvious is much more than a library. Underneath the various SDKs and integrations is a scalable modern API abstracting away the challenges of optimization infrastructure.
+ _Batteries-included_: Opvious has everything you need to solve optimization models out of the box. For example, you can write, test, and launch directly from a Python notebook - no solver installation required.
